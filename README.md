- Make separate deployments for production and development and configure CI
- Test coverage. There are no test right now
- Try integrating and benchmarking Planetscale [database-js](https://github.com/planetscale/database-js) or [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)
- Better styles? There are some bugs on edge cases right now.
